    <h1>Course</h1>
    <p>
        PTS (Penetration Testing Student) is good course for who would revise basic concepts and techniques. I also found
        Hera labs is very interesting and gained much experience from them. Course includes network , web and programming fundamentals.
        Penetaration Testing phase is also included with simple view.

    I successfully passed the eJPT (elearnSecurity Junior Penetration Testing). The total time of exam is three days.
    I started exam at 2:00 AM. At 7:00 AM, I could answer 15 questions and make sure that answers are right.After that,
    I went to take a cup of coffee and watched Tik Tok ^_^. I returned to exam at 8:00AM , finished exam at 11:00AM and scored
    18/20.
